Plasma Fractal
==============

When I was in high school, I had a minor obsession with implementing
fractals.  Probably my first really big breakthrough experience in
programming was seeing the Mandelbrot set materialize for the very
first time from a piece of code that I wrote.

For some reason, I could never crack the "plasma" fractal that I saw
in a few fractal drawing packages.  It was hard to find an easy to
understand description of it, which is odd, because it's a pretty
simple algorithm.

I finally figured it out while I was a student in college, and I was
so excited that I posted a web site with my explanation of how it
works.  That page is still available at:

The easiest way to try the applet is to go the above web site.  If you
want to compile the applet yourself, use:

    javac Plasma.java

There's an example HTML file that shows how to embed the compiled
class.  Feel free to change the dimensions.

Feel free to use and remix this source code!  I originally released
the applet with a header describing it as "public domain."  I don't
believe that a statement like that has any legal meaning, and it may
not have any force in some countries, so I've updated it to be
clearer.  As the author of the code, I give you permission to use it
however you want, with no restrictions.  That is, of course, the same
set of rights you would have for code that has truly entered the
public domain.  This is a simple piece of code, and I want people to
enjoy it without worrying!
