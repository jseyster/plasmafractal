Plasma Fractal
==============

When I was in high school, I had a minor obsession with implementing
fractals.  Probably my first really big breakthrough experience in
programming was seeing the Mandelbrot set materialize for the very
first time from a piece of code that I wrote.

For some reason, I could never crack the "plasma" fractal that I saw
in a few fractal drawing packages.  It was hard to find an easy to
understand description of it, which is odd, because it's a pretty
simple algorithm.

I finally figured it out while I was a student in college, and I was
so excited that I posted a web site with my explanation of how it
works.

The applet should be straightforward enough to compile:

    javac Plasma.java

There's an example HTML file that shows how to embed the compiled
class.  Feel free to change the dimensions.

Feel free to use and remix this source code!  I originally released
the applet with a header describing it as "public domain."  I don't
believe that a statement like that has any legal meaning, so I've
updated it to be clearer.  As the author of the code, I give you
permission to use it however you want, with no restrictions.  That is,
or course, the same set of rights you would have for code that has
truly entered the public domain.  This is a simple piece of code, and
I want people to enjoy it without worrying!
